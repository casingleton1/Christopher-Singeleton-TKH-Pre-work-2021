# TKH Pre-work 2021 for Christopher Singleton

Hi!

This is my pre-work assignment for The Knowledge House Fellowship application.

Currently, I'm a flight attendant. I am eager in learn the ins and out of cyber security. This would give me skills to change my income and therefore position in life. Part of me, also fantasizes about one day being on stage at the Apple Keynote, where Tim Cook or Craig Federighi asks me to demo a new product.

My interests include gaming, music, cooking and performance arts.

While I don't care for social media, I can be found on Linked in: https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-singleton-83a87058/
